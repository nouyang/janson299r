Well. Tasks to do: 

Implement RRT

More PRM / RRT -> what I want to do: write up mini report, investigate
* clutter
* maze
* more dimensions woo
* error bars
bidirectional RRT? and other fun things Implement `RRT*` and `FMT*`

Read `RRT*`-> more proof magic?  Read `FMT*`

* May be useful to write down things I learned each week, at this point. (from
  the technical perspective)



## Timeline

* 9/14: read RRT and PRM initial papers, confirmed this is happening
* 9/21: have RRT and PRM implemented in code with some simulation results
* 9/28: have more comprehensive simulation results and have read probabilistic completeness papers for RRT and PRM
* 10/5: talk more about probabilistic completeness and any exercises from previous week
* 10/12: discuss `RRT*` and its algorithms and mathematical results
* 10/19: dedicating entire week to fellowship applications
* 10/26: discuss `RRT*` paper more and just have read `FMT*` paper
* 11/2: have implementations of `RRT*`, `PRM*` and `FMT*`
* 11/9: go over some simulation results, discuss idea for improving algorithms
* 11/16: go through improved algorithm simulations, maybe produce videos
* 11/23: surprise!
* 11/30: outline / very rough draft due
* 12/7: rough draft or report due
* 12/14: Final report due and we'll talk about it
